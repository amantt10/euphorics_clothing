              In 2018, I began working with Region IV Timber Hills as an employment specialist. My role was to assist individuals with disabilities in finding or maintaining employment. In 2020, I transferred to a role with MDRS as a vocational counselor where I continued to work with individuals on overcoming barriers to employment by use of assistive technology or with the assistance of job skills trainers and counseling and guidance. This role took a hit because of the covid-19 pandemic and the somewhat long commute I had to work so I moved to working with MDES at a WIN job center in my hometown. In this job I assisted individuals with finding employment and developed ways to market employment opportunities to the public. I also matched individuals up with training or resources if they weren't qualified for the career role they wanted. My most recent role has been with Human Sciences at MSU and a large part of my role there was resource and referral and matching individuals to services or resources they needed such as mental health, job search, childcare.
